Personal dotfiles and tools.

## Mackup vs Git

**Note:** Currently, [on macOS14, mackup doesn't work](https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/1924)

Mackup has the option to backup bash and more dotfiles.

In my personal preference, I rather have my dotfiles in git because dotfiles are a big part of my
workflow and are changed often and having the proper version control is important to me.

Application configuration is more 'static' and sensitive.
Mackup is a great solution since it's less important to document the changes.

## Installation

To install dot files and CLI utilities, use `make install`.

To restore Raycast DB, restore private `application password` items from the `login` keychain.

## Hardware

Refer to [Hardware README](/Hardware).
